| Operation                  | List                   | String |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| Appending to end           | O(1) [Ammortized O(1)] | O(n)   |
| Popping from end           | O(1)                   | O(n)   |
| Insertion , not from end   | O(n)                   | O(n)   |
| Deletion , not from end    | O(n)                   | O(n)   |
| Modifying an element       | O(1)                   | O(n)   |
| Random access              | O(1)                   | O(1)   |
| Checking if element exists | O(n)                   | O(n)   |
